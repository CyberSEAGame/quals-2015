The "FindTheFlag.pcap" file is a packet capture file of a telnet session using the nc command.
The ACKNOWLEDGE numbers in it are changed, so you can't see the stream message using "Follow TCP Stream" of the Fireshark.
The order of packets is not changed.
To change the numbers into the range of blanks and open it with wireshark, it will be warning for incorrect packets, so you can correct the numbers.
Or to see the data section in packets, you can find a flag caracter each packet and built a flag message to correct them.
