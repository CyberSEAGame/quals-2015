The "packet.data" file is a pcap file without the header.
You can see a message to add the header and open it with the wireshark, or to open it with a text/binary editor.
The message is "ZmxhZ3tUaGVyZSBpcyBhbHdheXMgYSBiZXR0ZXIgd2F5Ln0=", so it's a base64 enocded message.
To decode it, you can see a message "flag{There is always a better way.}"
