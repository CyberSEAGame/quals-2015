Answer: flag{Without haste, but without rest.}
Words by Goethe: Don't hurry but not rest

Original source is below
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
if(1>2){
printf("fla");
printf("g{W");
printf("ith");
printf("out");
printf(" ha");
printf("ste");
printf(", b");
printf("ut ");
printf("wit");
printf("hou");
printf("t r");
printf("est");
printf(".}\n");
}
}
